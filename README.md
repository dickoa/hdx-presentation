## HDX HTML Presentation
![Screen Grab](screengrab.png)

Presentation about the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.hdx.rwlabs.org) project by the [United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)](http://unocha.org/). The presentation goes over the main HDX features, the contribute data flow, etc. and mentions about the API and media coverage. It contains two modes: Manual or Automated. Manual is ideal for flipping slides during a presentation. Automated is ideal for letting the presentation run in a booth or a monitor somewhere.
